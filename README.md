# First_year_projects_at_Epitech_Nantes

This repository contains most of projects done in my first year at Epitech

## Before continuing...

This project is an EPITECH Project. If you are an EPITECH student, move out the way! Nothing to see here... I don't want to be involved to your -42.
If you're not, no worries! You're welcome here!

### Building program

Most of project can be build with make / make re rules
Launch the binary with the flags if necessary
Clean all the project with make clean / make fclean

### Coding Style

All of the projects are developed with C/C++ except designsprint that is in react-native. EPITECH doesn't impose it's Coding Style to the projects
and I tried to follow it as much as possible.
